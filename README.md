# Locating-Emergency-Unit-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

## This project solves the [Locating the Emergency Unit problem using Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/kurlp00/Locating-Emergency-Unit-Using-Genetic-Algorithm/blob/master/problem/Laboratory_3b_Emergency_Unit_using_GA.pdf).

**Notes**
- May take sometimes hundred plus generations before displaying optimized solution.
- Some genetic operations and population operations can still be optimized.
